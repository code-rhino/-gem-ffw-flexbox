A practical use of flex box,

which is the Bento box style, where you can have,

this kind of dashboard layout

and have all these individual boxes

that have their own style, width, color, and dynamics.

But it can actually flow with the page.

So this will look good, whether it's on a tablet,

a mobile phone, or a desktop.

We're on dribble.com.

It's a great place to get some inspiration.

And here are some really nice examples of

how Bento boxes are used or the style is used.

And this is all using flex box.

All right, so let's jump into a practical example.

All right, so we're starting off with a webpage.

And on the webpage, we have the body,

and then we have this div

for the container bento box.

And then we have these individual boxes in here.

These individual boxes all have an id.

And then inside those boxes, there's a number.

You can see all those right here.

They're stacked up, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

and everything else is the default fixture.

So let's actually add some shape to these boxes.

So, the first thing that we're going to do is we're going

to start messing with this class box.

So let's add a style for box.

So first off, we're going to say that box

is going to display; it's a move to blocks for flex.

And then we're going to align the items in the center of the box,

and we're going to justify the content also,

which will center our stuff in the middle of it,

align the items, we'll center it in

the height, and then justify content.

We'll center in the middle. Set the color

of the default color of the text in the boxes.

If we set it to white right now, we won't be able

to see it.

So I'm going to set it to Aqua right now

and we'll set it to white later.

Because we don't have any.

And as you can already see just

by these things right here.

So the justified content centers it

in the middle of the div.

The default div width is the width of the page.

If I take this out, it will put it

to the left-hand side.

The align item center will center it in

the middle of the box.

Right now, the height of the box is the height

of the content, so you're not really seeing the effects

of that right now.

But we will shortly,

we're going to set the default font size to

24 pixels,

and we're going to set the weight of it to bold font,

weight to bold.

All right, and there we go. So we get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Okay. So now let's add some height and width

and colors to the individual boxes.

So what we're going to do is for box one, we're going

to set the background color to a reddish

or a tomato color.

ff6347.

And we're going to set the background color.

Okay, that shouldn't be an issue.

Yep. Is it too many? I got too many numbers.

I do too many numbers. Okay.

So that's just a background color for it. Perfect.

Then we're going to set the width to be 150 pixels,

and we're going to set the height to 100 pixels.

All right. And that's for our first box.

So now I'm going to just copy this and do our second box.

We're going to say box two.

And we're going to change some of the stuff up in here.

So box two is going to be more of a,

steel blue color.

So that's going to be 4682B4.

Get rid of the extra hashtag

and let's change the width to a hundred.

And we'll change the height to 150,

like have it all changed that way.

All right? Cool. And then let's do the third box.

Okay. So box three

and box three will be, let's say, 32CD32.

And that's more of a lime green color.

And we can see that down here.

I'm going to, so we have more space that's more

of a lime green color.

And we're going to set the width of this to 200

And the height should,

we're going to keep the height at a hundred.

Yeah, that works. Well, make this a hundred. Alright.

And now what we're going to do is we're going to do,

box four.

I'm just going to speed this up a little bit

.

So, that's going to be, hashtag

FFD700,

and that'll give us kind of a gold color.

And we're going to make the height 120

and the width of 120.

Yeah. Okay.

And we got to do for box five

and box six, box

five, okay.

So box five, we're going to go for more

of a slate blue here.

So that's going to be, 6A5ACD.

All right. And we can see that down here.

And the height is going to be 180.

We did 180, and the width is going to be 90.

And the final box is box six.

So boom box six is going to be a hot pink color.

So let's do, FF69B4.

Now that'll give us that hot pink color we were looking for.

And let's do this at a hundred pixels.

All right. So it's a hundred pixels there

and we want to make that,

make it a little bit bigger.

So the height's going to be 200. Okay.

So here we have all of our boxes

and they're kind of stacked on top of each other.

So we're starting to get, you can start to see

where we're going with this, where we have the shape of the,

each box has a different shape and different content.

And I'm going to go back up here

and change this from an aqua color to white.

That might be a little bit better. There you go.

Alright, so now what we need to do is we need

to work on the bento box container.

So let's do that.

So the Bento box container right here, bento box.

Okay. So we're going to make sure

that we display flex here.

So we're going to display flex,

we're going to save that right away.

And as you can see immediately, by displaying flex,

they're no longer stacking, from top

to bottom, but from left to right.

And then we're going to do a flex wrap,

and we're going to set that to wrap.

And now what this is doing is wrapping around. Okay.

And we're starting

to get the shape that we're looking for.

We're going to justify the content,

in our Bento box itself to the center.

So you'll see everything move to the center of the page

where we have our margins on the

left and the right, and they're equal.

And then we're going to set a

gap between each box.

So we're going to see a gap of 10 px,

And now there's a gap of 10 pixels between each box.

And we're going to set a padding

of 10 px.

And by doing that, what you see is we have established

that Bento box style.

And as the page expands, we get,

all the boxes rearrange themselves so

that it looks good in each container,

and each box gets the appropriate space that it needs.

And this is a great use, an example of bento boxes.
